# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I added a navbar to my project and started creating the posts on node.js

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm starting to really understand node.js and the whole world of web programming, how the requisitions and answers work, I'm very happy to see that my code is actually working in parts.

I also understood how the mongoDB search system works and I plan to structure my TodoList so that each user has his list. I will do this with each user who create an account and create a new collection for him
