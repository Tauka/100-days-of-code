# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I added a navbar to my project and started creating the posts on node.js

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm starting to really understand node.js and the whole world of web programming, how the requisitions and answers work, I'm very happy to see that my code is actually working in parts.

I also understood how the mongoDB search system works and I plan to structure my TodoList so that each user has his list. I will do this with each user who create an account and create a new collection for him

### Day 1: January 04, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I made the system login, register and changed the display structure of mongoDB.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy that I was able to make the login system, cookie / request and not losing session, everything is going in a surreal way, I am really understanding the programming thing.

I have also been able to adjust my collections for mongoDB, now every user has his own registry and his own lists and things to do.

But I know that there are many, many days to go. I'm making progress!
